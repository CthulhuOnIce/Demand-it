# Demand it! (Kevified)

## What is this?
This is a fork of [Demand it!](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1445449208&searchtext=)

This mod allows you to manually make these demands to other nations:
- Demand State
- Demand Vassalization (Puppet)
- Demand Tribute
- Demand Demilitarization of the state

Demands cost large amounts of political power to make, and if a nation refuses certain demands, the demanding nation gets an instant wargoal.

This fork has some added tweaks I felt were necessary to the game, principally that whereas the base game only allows you to make demands to neighboring countries, I adjusted it slightly so that you may make demands to neighboring countries ***and*** countries that neighbor your faction as well. 

I plan to add some more features, but I haven't decided specifically what to add yet.
